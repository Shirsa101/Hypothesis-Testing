This activity is a part of a bigger fictional agenda in which a data professional working for the Department of a large nation is analyzing data on the 
literacy rate for each district. 
Supposing the data professional has been tasked to to collect data on mean district literacy rates for two of the nation's largest states :
STATE21 and STATE28. STATE28 has almost 40 districts, and STATE21 has more than 70. Due to limited time and resources, they are only able to survey 20
randomly chosen districts in each state. The department has asked to determine if the differnce between the two mean district literacy rates is 
statistically significant or due to chance. This will help the department decide how to distribute government funding to improve literacy.
If there is a statistically-significant difference, the state with the lower literacy rate may receive more funding. 

In this activity, I have used Python to simulate taking a random sample of 20 districts in each state and conduct a two sample t-test based on the sample data.
